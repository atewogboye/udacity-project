## Steps taken to Improve Documentation
Create a branch named documentation on your local repository.
Switch to the documentation branch.
Update your README.md file.
Stage your changes.
Commit your work with a descriptive message.
Push your commit to your remote repository branch 
Switch back to the main branch.

## Additional Changes to Documentation
Switch to the documentation  branch.
Make at least 2 additional changes to the documentation - this might be additional changes to the README or changes to the document strings and line comments of the bikeshare file.
After each change, stage and commit your changes. When you commit your work, you should use a descriptive message of the changes made.  Your changes should be small and aligned with your commit message.
Push your changes to the remote repository branch.
Switch back to the main branch.
Check the local repository log to see how all the branches have changed.
Go to Github.  Notice that you now have two branches available for your project, and when you change branches the README changes.
