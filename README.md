# Version Control with Git

This is the repo for [new git project](). In the project, students are expected to use what they've learnt in version control while learning the basics to intermediate knowledge of Git to complete the project.

This repo contains the source code for the new git project.

## Steps taken for task 1
Clone the GitHub repository to your local repository.
Move your bikeshare.py and data files into your local repository.
Create a .gitignore file containing the name of your data file.
List the file names associated with the data files you added to your .gitignore

## Steps taken to Improve Documentation
Create a branch named documentation on your local repository.
Switch to the documentation branch.
Update your README.md file.
Stage your changes.
Commit your work with a descriptive message.
Push your commit to your remote repository branch 
Switch back to the main branch.

## Additional Changes to Documentation
Switch to the documentation  branch.
Make at least 2 additional changes to the documentation - this might be additional changes to the README or changes to the document strings and line comments of the bikeshare file.
After each change, stage and commit your changes. When you commit your work, you should use a descriptive message of the changes made.  Your changes should be small and aligned with your commit message.
Push your changes to the remote repository branch.
Switch back to the main branch.
Check the local repository log to see how all the branches have changed.
Go to Github.  Notice that you now have two branches available for your project, and when you change branches the README changes.


## REFACTOR CODE
Create a branch named refactoring on your local repository.
Switch to the refactoring  branch.
Similar to the process you used in  making the documentation changes, make 2 or more changes in refactoring your code.
